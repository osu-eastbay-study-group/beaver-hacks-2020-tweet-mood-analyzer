* Description
Given a link to a specific tweet, *Tweet.Tone* will fetch the tweet
and analyze the emotional tones in its contentusing IBM Watson's [[https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/tone-analyzer?topic=tone-analyzer-about#about][Tone
Analyzer]]. It will then display the most dominant tones as colored dots
next to the Tweet as well as generating tones for any comments made
directly in response to it. The tones for the comments will be
generated in a rectangular array of dots colored by tones under the
searched tweet.

Additionally the user may click on any of the comment dots which will show its
content along with its most dominant tone breakdown.
